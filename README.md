A quite simple REST application that represents the work of the cinema, where user can buy tickets for a specific movie session (definite movie in definite cinema hall). To buy tickets user firstly adds them to the shopping cart and then completes an order. There are authentication and authorization. User can have different roles: USER, ADMIN, or no role.
